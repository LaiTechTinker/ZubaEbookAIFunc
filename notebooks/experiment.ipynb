Fundamental of Engineering Thermodynamics (CHE 242) CHAPTER ONE  1. INTRODUCTION  The word thermodynamics is a combination of two words, thermo which means heat and dynamics which means force.  Thermodynamics is a subject that deals with the transformation of energy of all kinds from one form to another in processes involving either physical or chemical changes. It cannot however handle the issue of rates of transformation.  As a subject, it is concerned with quantification of inter-relation between energy and the change of state of any real world system. It is restricted to the definition of the direction through which transformation of energy can take place and the amount of transformation possible. The extent of such change of state due to transfer of energy to or from the system is captured through the basic equations of thermodynamics which are derived starting from a set of fundamental observations known as “Laws of Thermodynamics”. These laws of thermodynamics have applications ranging from the microscopic to the macroscopic order, and indeed to cosmological processes. It can therefore be said that all processes taking place in the universe, whether in non-living or living systems, are subject to the laws of thermodynamics.  1.2 Thermodynamic System: Basic Definitions  There are some terms that will be repeatedly used in this course. This section gives the definition of these basic terms. 1.2.1 A system, in general, is any part of the universe which may be defined by a boundary which distinguishes it from the rest of the universe. Such a thermodynamic system is usually referred to as control volume as it would possess a volume and would also contain a definite quantity of matter. The system boundary may be real or imaginary, and may change in shape as well as in size over time, i.e., increase or decrease.  1.2.2 Any part of the universe that is external to the system constitutes the surroundings. The combination of the system and surroundings is called the universe. That is'),\n",

An open system is one which involves exchange of mass or matter between it and its surrounding.  A closed system does not allow any transfer of mass (material) across its boundary. In either case energy transfer can occur across the system boundary in any of its various forms; for example, heat, work, electrical / magnetic energy, etc. However, for most real-world systems of interest to chemical engineers the primary forms of energy that may transfer across boundaries are heat and work. In contrast to closed or open systems, a system which is enclosed by a boundary that allows neither mass nor energy transfer is an isolated system.  1.2.4 A Thermodynamic state of a system is a condition of the system to which can be ascribed clearly defined attributes or properties. 1.2.5 Thermodynamic properties are typically classified as intensive and extensive.  An intensive property is independent of the extent (size) of the system for which it is defined. Examples are temperature, pressure and mass density. An extensive property is one with a magnitude that is dependent on the extent of mass involved in the system or medium. Examples are volume, internal energy, enthalpy, kinetic energy and potential energy. If the extensive properties are defined per unit mass, they yield the equivalent intensive properties. Thus, we have specific volume (n), specific internal energy (𝑢), specific enthalpy (ℎ), specific kinetic energy 𝑒5=67𝜐7, and specific potential energy 𝑒9=𝑔𝑧. Note that the quantifier “specific” implies “per unit mass” while “molar” denotes “per unit mole”. The ratio of an extensive property to the mass or the property per unit mass is called specific property. The ratio of an extensive property to the number of moles of the substance in the system, or the property per mole of the substance, is called the molar property.  Specific volume  n=𝑉<𝑚=        1.2 molar volume  V=𝑉<𝑛=        1.3 1.2.6 A thermodynamic process is a transformation which takes a system from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state through a succession of states. The aggregates of states traversed by the process defines the process path'),\n",

Examples of state functions are temperature, pressure, mass density, internal energy, volume and enthalpy. Consider a gas at a certain temperature and a pressure within a piston-cylinder assembly which we may assume to be isolated. If the piston position is held fixed at this point the gas state is said to be characterized by the temperature and the pressure and its corresponding volume. If the gas is compressed, the gas will also attain a new equilibrium state wherein the pressure and temperature would attain a new set of values. If, on the other hand the extra applied pressure is removed and the gas reverts to the earlier state the original temperature and pressure (and, of course volume) is restored. Extending this argument, in general, if the gas is heated or cooled, compressed or expanded, and then returned to its initial temperature and pressure, its intensive properties are restored to their initial values. It is evident, therefore, that such properties do not depend on the past history of the fluid or on the path by which it reaches a given state. They depend only on present state, irrespective of how they are attained. Such quantities are thus defined as state variables. Mathematically, this idea may be expressed as follows:  ∫𝑑𝑇=𝑇7@A@B −𝑇6=∆𝑇; ∫𝑑𝑉=𝑉7EAEB −𝑉6=∆𝑉; ∫𝑑𝑃=𝑃7GAGB −𝑃6=∆𝑃 1.4 The changes in the above intensive properties depend only on the initial and final states of the system. They constitute point functions and their differentials are exact.  A path function however, depends on the process. Consider the case of thermodynamic work depicted as the area under the curve on a P-V graph. This is illustrated in fig. 1.1.'),\n",

It follows that if one were to go from state ‘1’ to ‘2’ by path X and then return to ‘1’ by path Y the work in the two processes would differ and so one would not be giving and taking work out of the system in equal measure. An entity such as P-V work is, therefore, described as a path variable, and therefore is not directly dependent on the state of the system. Heat is another example of path function. 1.2.9 Energies associated with Thermodynamic Processes:\\u2028 These are forms that energy assumes when it is resident in a system. The internal energy on intrinsic energy 𝒖\\tis energy possessed by a body/ medium by virtue of its configuration. It is the energy possessed by matter due to the microscopic modes of motion. The microscopic variety of energy forms the principal consideration in case of transformations that occur in a thermodynamic system. The potential energy 𝐸9is the energy which exist in a medium due to its relative elevation in the gravitational field. For body with mass 𝑚, acceleration due to gravity 𝑔 and and elevation relative to reference level 𝑧, potential energy has the mathematical definition 𝐸9=𝑚𝑔𝑧              1.5 The kinetic energy is a measure of the state of motion of a body on a macroscopic level.

Work is said to be accomplished when a force experiences a displacement. Heat is that form of energy which when transmitted to or from a medium causes a change either in its degree of hotness or its phase. In general work refers to a form of energy transfer which results due to changes in the external macroscopic physical constraints on a thermodynamic system. For example, electrical work results when a charge moves against an externally applied electrical field. It is mechanical work that is most commonly encountered in real thermodynamic systems, for example a typical chemical plant.   1.2.11 Enthalpy This is a thermodynamic function which features in the analysis of flow processes. It is defined by 𝐻=𝑈+𝑃𝑉            1.7 where 𝑃 is pressure and 𝑉\\tis total volume. 1.2.12 Thermodynamic Equilibrium  In general change of state of a thermodynamic system results from existence of gradients of various types within or across its boundary. Thus a gradient of pressure results in momentum or convective transport of mass. Temperature gradients result in heat transfer, while a gradient of concentration (more exactly, of chemical potential) promotes diffusive mass transfer. Thus, as long as internal or cross-boundary gradients of any form as above exist with respect to a thermodynamic system it will undergo change of state in time. The result of all such changes is to annul the gradient that in the first place causes the changes. This process will continue till all types of gradients are nullified. In the ultimate limit one may then conceive of a state where all gradients (external or internal) are non-existent and the system exhibits no further changes. Under such a limiting condition, the system is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. For a system to be thermodynamic equilibrium, it thus needs to also satisfy the criteria for mechanical, thermal and'),\n",

Types of Thermodynamic Equilibrium  A thermodynamic system may exist in various forms of equilibrium: stable, unstable and metastable. These diverse types of equilibrium states may be understood through analogy with a simple mechanical system as depicted in fig. 1.2 – a spherical body in a variety of gradients on a surface.  \\n Fig. 1.2 Types of Mechanical Equilibrium  Consider the body to be initially in state ‘I’. If disturbed by a mechanical force of a very small magnitude the body will return to its initial state. However, if the disturbance is of a large magnitude, the body is unlikely to return to its initial state. In this type of situation the body is said to be in unstable equilibrium. Consider next the state ‘II’; even a very small disturbance will move the body to either positions ‘I’ or ‘III’. This type of original equilibrium state is termed metastable. Lastly, if the body is initially in state ‘III’, it will tend to return to this state even under the influence of relatively larger disturbances. The body is then said to be in a stable equilibrium state.  1.3 Some Types of Processes 1.3.1 Reversible and Irreversible Thermodynamic Processes  In the absence of any gradients (or motive forces) a thermodynamic system continues to remain in a state of equilibrium. Obviously, if a disturbance (i.e., mechanical, thermal or chemical potential gradient) is impressed upon such a system it will transit from its initial state of equilibrium. However, as it moves away from its initial state the originally applied gradients will diminish progressively in time, and ultimately when they are reduced to infinitesimal levels the system will attain a new equilibrium state. A question arises here as to the nature of the process of change: if the initially impressed disturbances are reversed in direction (not magnitude) can the system return'),\n",

If that happens we depict the process as reversible, if not, then the process is termed irreversible. A reversible process must satisfy the following two conditions a. It should experience negligible differences in mechanical potential and any other potential. It should therefore be quasi-static, that is occurring extremely slowly b. It must be devoid of any form of friction both internal and external. Because real processes violate at least one of these constraints, every real process is irreversible to some degree. 1.3.2 An isothermal process is a process which occurs such that the temperature of the system is constant at every point along the process path. An isobaric process is a process occurs such that the system does not experience any change in pressure through out the process. An isochoric or isometric process is a process which occurs at a constant system volume. An isenthalpic process is a process which charts a constant-enthalpy path. An adiabatic process is a process which does not involve any heat interaction between the system and its surrounding. 1.4 The Phase Rule  Originally formulated by the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs in the 1870’s, the phase rule determines the number of independent variables that must be specified to establish the intensive state of any system at equilibrium and hence fix all other properties of the system 𝐹=𝐶+2−𝑃−𝑟           1.8 where 𝐹 is the degree of freedom, C is the number of components or chemical species in the system, 𝑃 is the number of phases present in the system and 𝑟 is the number of independent reactions that may occur between the system components. For a non-reactive system, the phase rule simplifies to:   𝐹=𝐶+2−𝑃            1.9 In the most general sense a thermodynamic system may be multiphase and multi- component in nature. A phase is a form of matter that is homogeneous in chemical composition and physical'),\n",

Typical phases are solids, liquids and gases. For a multiphase system, interfaces typically demarcate the various phases, properties changing abruptly across such interfaces. Various phases can coexist, but they must be in equilibrium for the phase rule to apply. An example of a three-phase system at equilibrium is water at its triple point (~ 0oC, and 0.0061 bar), with ice, water and steam co-existing. A system involving one pure substance is an example of a single-component system. On the other hand mixtures of water and acetone have two chemically independent components.   The degrees of freedom derivable from the phase rule gives the number of variables which must be specified to fix all other remaining phase-rule variables. For example, superheated steam (water vapour at its saturation temperature) has 𝐶=1,and  𝑃=1. Hence 𝐹=1+2−1=2. Specifying the temperature and pressure fixes the state and all other properties (specific volume, enthalpy, internal energy, e.t.c). On the other hand, wet steam  (a mixture  of liquid water and water vapour) has 𝐶=1,and  𝑃=2; hence 𝐹=1+2−2=1 and it is sufficient to fix either the temperature or the pressure in order to fix the state and all other properties.'),\n",

Thermal equilibrium implies equality of temperature  2.2 The First Law of Thermodynamics The law of conservation and conversion of energy is the fundamental general law of nature.

It suffers the limitation of failing to provide any clue as to the direction of change and the transformation that can occur spontaneously. Thus, going by the first law alone, it should be possible to convert a given quantity of heat completely into work energy and a kettle of water placed on a hot stove should be able to lose energy in form of heat to the stove and in the process bring about the freezing of the water. Experience is however contrary to this. The second law addresses the issue, imposing restrictions on the direction of energy transformations and providing the criterion for the spontaneity of a process. It need be mentioned that the second law is a product of experiential observations involving heat engines that powered the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. A heat engine is a machine that produces work from heat through a cyclic process. An example is a steam power plant in which the working fluid (steam) periodically goes through a series of steps in a cyclic manner as follows:  • Step 1: Liquid water at ambient temperature is pumped into a boiler operating at high pressure\\u2028 • Step 2: Heat released by burning a fossil fuel is transferred in the boiler to the water, converting it to steam at high-temperature and pressure \\u2028 • Step 3: The energy contained in the steam is then transferred as shaft work to a turbine; during this process steam temperature an    d pressure are reduced. \\u2028 • Step 4: Steam exiting the turbine is converted to water by cooling it and transferring the heat released to the surroundings. The water is then returned to step 1. \\u2028 • The schematic of a heat engine (for example: steam / gas power plant, automotive engines, etc) is shown in fig. 3.1'),\n",

Any system that undergoes transformation from a given state to a less ordered state (such as temperature elevation without phase change, mixing of two or more fluids of different compositions and phase transformation from solid to liquid (fusion), liquid to vapour (vapourisation) or solid to vapour (sublimation) experiences an increase in entropy.

EVALUATION OF THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES 4.1Thermodynamic Work Tools In thermodynamic analysis, the laws of thermodynamics serve as basic working tools. But these laws are defined in terms of properties of the system. It follows therefore, that there should be adequate data on the properties of the system for any given process. In generating such data, experimentation is often resorted to. However, not all the thermodynamic properties can be measured experimentally. While mass, pressure, temperature, specific heat capacity, specific volume (mass density) can be measured experimentally, properties such as internal energy, enthalpy and entropy do not yield to experimental measurement. To generate data for properties in the latter class, use is made of thermodynamic relationships that define these properties as functions of the measurable properties. In obtaining such relationships, the following two thermodynamic functions play useful roles • Gibbs Free Energy, G: This is an extensive property defined by 𝐺=𝐻−𝑇𝑆         4.1 The specific Gibbs free energy is   𝑔=ℎ−𝑇𝑠         4.2 • Helmholtz Free Energy, A: The Helmholtz free energy also called the work function is an extensive property defined by  𝐴=𝑈−𝑇𝑆         4.3  The specific Helmholtz free energy 𝑎 is given by'),\n",

If we choose a reversible non-flow process (a closed system) and take the system to be a unit mass of a homogenous material, then we have 𝛿𝑤=𝑝𝑑𝑣  and 𝛿𝑞=𝑇𝑑𝑠 (from the second law) and the first law yields  𝑑𝑢=𝑇𝑑𝑠−𝑃𝑑𝑣         4.5 From the definition of enthalpy, we have  𝑑ℎ=𝑑𝑢+𝑑(𝑃𝑣)=𝑇𝑑𝑠−𝑃𝑑𝑣+𝑃𝑑𝑣+𝑣𝑑𝑃  𝑑ℎ=𝑇𝑑𝑠+𝑣𝑑𝑃          4.6 The definition of the specific work function equation 4.4 results in 𝑑𝑎=𝑑𝑢−𝑑(𝑇𝑠)=𝑇𝑑𝑠−𝑃𝑑𝑣−𝑇𝑑𝑠−𝑠𝑑𝑇     𝑑𝑎=\\t−𝑠𝑑𝑇−𝑃𝑑𝑣         4.7 Employing the definition of the specific Gibbs free energy (eqn. 4.2), we obtain 𝑑𝑔\\t=𝑑ℎ−𝑑(𝑇𝑠)=𝑇𝑑𝑠+𝑣𝑑𝑃−𝑇𝑑𝑠−𝑠𝑑𝑇  𝑑𝑔=\\t−𝑠𝑑𝑇+𝑣𝑑𝑃         4.8 It can be clearly seen that equations 4.5 through 4.8 involve only properties and they are very useful in thermodynamic property data generation.  4.3 Specific Heat Capacities Heat capacity information is generally required in the process of generating data for thermodynamic properties which cannot be measured experimentally.

On the other hand, compressible fluids (gases and vapours) have specific heat capacities that depend on the nature of the process.

One of these is the isochoric specific heat capacity 𝑐B given by  𝑐B=:;<=>?CDEFGHIFH\\tB=\\t:;JKLK?MB=JKNK?MB      4.10  The other one is the isobaric specific heat capacity 𝑐O\\tgiven by   𝑐O=:;<=>?CDEFGHIFH\\tO=\\t:;JKPK?MO=JKQK?MO      4.11 It should be noted that the specific heat capacities are intensive state variables.   4.4 Maxwell’s Relations  Consider equation 4.5 which gives 𝑢 as a function of 𝑠 and 𝑣.

The following guidelines will be useful: 1. All the four Maxwell relations involve four properties: T, v, P and S. Of these, only S cannot be measured experimentally. Thus, in setting up thermodynamic working relationships for data generation, any derivative involving S is eliminated by means of Maxwell’s relations leaving derivatives involving the measurable properties T, v and P. 2. The development of the working relationships would generally involve either equation 4.5 or equation 4.6 at the early stage. If, in the process, an S derivative having (𝑇,𝑣)as independent variables is generated, the Maxwell relation deriving from the Helmholtz function (that is equation 4.17 deriving from equation 4.7), is used to eliminate the S derivative. If on the other hand an S derivative having (𝑇,𝑃)as independent variables is generated, the Maxwell relation deriving from the Gibbs function (that is equation 4.18 deriving from equation 4.8), is used to eliminate it. 3. The Maxwell relations can easily be generated from the thermodynamic mnemonic diagram shown in figure 4.1 which is constructed from equations 4.5 through 4.8. the sides of the square are labelled with the four functions  (𝑎,𝑔,ℎ,𝑢) in alphabetical order clockwise with 𝑎 at the top. The variables (𝑣,𝑇,𝑃,𝑆) are then placed at the vertices of the square such that each function is flanged by its two independent variables. The diagonals are constructed with arrows pointing upwards. To determine the Maxwell relation based on a given energy function, the side containing it is made the base, the adjacent side conceptually becoming the vertical sides. Then, the two equal derivatives are obtained by differentiating each variable at the top of a ‘vertical’ side with respect to the one at its bottom holding that at the bottom of the other vertical side constant. Where the arrow points to the top of the vertical sides, the derivative takes a positive sign, otherwise, it is negative.'),\n",

Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics (CHE242)  5.0  𝑷−𝑽−𝑻 RELATIONS OF GASES AND LIQUIDS 5.1  𝑷−𝑽−𝑻 BEHAVIOUR OF PURE GASES The data generation working relationships presented in chapter 4 reveal that information relating pressure, volume and temperature is required in the process of generating data on the unmeasurable properties. The pressure-volume-temperature (𝑃−𝑉−𝑇) behavior of gases has enjoyed much of the attention in view of the high compressibility of gases which makes their volumes to be highly sensitive to pressure changes.  Information of the 𝑃−𝑉−𝑇 behavior of a pure gas is often presented in the form of an equation of state which is a semi-empirical mathematical correlation relating 𝑃,𝑣 (or 𝑉\\t𝑎𝑛𝑑\\t𝑚) and 𝑇 through a few empirical parameters. The simplest known equation of state (EOS) is the ideal gas law. Where the ideal gas law is not suitable, some other complex equations of state (the van der Waals EOS, Redlich-Kwong EOS, and popular modifications of it by Wilson and by Soave, the Benedict-Webb-Rubin(BWR) EOS, etc) could be used. Apart from these, charts defining gas-phase 𝑃−𝑉−𝑇 behavior have been developed based on the principle of corresponding states. 5.1.1 The Ideal Gas: The ideal gas model is founded on the assumption of zero force of interaction among molecules. Real gases behave essentially like the ideal gas at sufficiently low pressure and sufficiently high temperature. An ideal gas is governed by the ideal gas law which is given by the relation 𝑃𝑉=𝑛𝑅1𝑇          5.1 where in SI units, 𝑛 is in kmole, 𝑉 is total volume in m3, and 𝑅1 is in J/(kmole.K). 𝑅1 is the universal gas constant and is 8.314J/(kmole.K). Equation 5.1 may be written on the basis of 1kmole as 𝑃𝑣=𝑅1𝑇          5.2 where 𝑣 is molar volume (m3/kmole).  The ideal gas law can also be stated on a mass (rather than molar ) basis. Then it becomes 𝑃𝑉=𝑚𝑅𝑇          5.3 where 𝑚 is in kg and 𝑅 is a specific gas constant in J/(kg/K) and is related to 𝑅1 by 𝑅=𝑅1/𝑀          5.4'),\n",

Equation 5.3 expressed on the basis of 1kg becomes 𝑃𝑣=𝑅𝑇          5.5 where 𝑣 is specific volume (m3/kg). Some useful relationships are presented next  Internal energy:  Using equation 5.5, we have 𝑇4565789=:79=𝑃, so that equation 4.22 becomes 𝑑𝑢=𝑐=𝑑𝑇          5.6 While 𝑐9 is generally a function of 𝑇 and 𝑣, it depends only on 𝑇 for an ideal gas. It follows from equation 5.6 that 𝑢\\tis a function of 𝑇 only for an ideal gas.  Enthalpy: Equation 5.5, gives 𝑇4595786=:76=𝑣, so that equation 4.27 reduces to 𝑑ℎ=𝑐6𝑑𝑇          5.7 For an ideal gas, 𝑐6\\t\\tdepends only on 𝑇 (for real gases, it also depends on 𝑃)\\tand equation 5.7 leads to the conclusion that ℎ is a function of 𝑇 only for an ideal gas. Note that equations 5.6 and 5.7 are applicable to any process involving an ideal gas, irrespective of the process path.  Entropy: Substituting 4595786from equation 5.5 into equation 4.31 gives 𝑑𝑠=𝑐6A77\\t−𝑅A66         5.8 While the use of 4565789obtained from equation 5.5 results in  𝑑𝑠=𝑐=A77+𝑅A99         5.9 Either Equation 5.8 or 5.9 can be used to evaluate ∆𝑠 for a process involving an ideal gas.

For an isothermal process in a closed system, substituting equation 5.3 for 𝑃 in equation 2.8 and integrating gives 𝑊=𝑚𝑅𝑇𝑙𝑛4=H=I8. Since 𝑇 is constant and 𝑚 and 𝑅 are constants, Equation 5.3 gives 𝑃𝑉=𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 or 𝑃E𝑉E=𝑃L𝑉L. Hence we also have 𝑊=𝑚𝑅𝑇𝑙𝑛46I6H8. Equation 5.6 yields 𝑑𝑢=0 or ∆𝑢=0. So that the first law gives 𝑄=𝑊. 2.

Integrating equation 5.9 from state 1 to state 2 gives  ∆𝑠=\\t𝑐=𝑙𝑛47H7I8+𝑅𝑙𝑛49H9I8      5.11 if the process is isentropic, ∆𝑠=0 and equation 5.11 yields 𝑙𝑛47H7I8=:PQ𝑙𝑛49I9H8  OR 47H7I8=49I9H8RSQ OR  𝑇𝑣RSQ=𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡.

A polytropic process is one which is governed by the general relationship 𝑃𝑉[=𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡        5.17 where the exponent  𝑛 can be determined experimentally and is equal to ∝ only for an isentropic process. Employing equation 5.17 in evaluating 𝑊from equation 2.8 gives the equivalents of equations 5.15 and 5.16 with ∝ replaced by 𝑛.

Considering from the definition of 𝑧, we find that 𝑧=1 for an ideal gas. Equation 5.21 therefore, represents a modification of the ideal gas law which is applicable to gases that do not obey the ideal-gas law. The departure of the behavior of a gas from ideal gas behavior is measured by the deviation of its compressibility factor from one. In order to employ equation 5.21 in analysis, compressibility factor data are required. Such data have been generated for various substances. A comparison of these data reveals that all substances have essentially the same value of 𝑧 for a given set of (𝑃l\\t,𝑇l), where   𝑃l=66S           5.22 and 𝑇l=77S          5.23 𝑃P and\\t𝑇P represent 𝑃 and 𝑇 at the critical point. The critical point is denoted by point 𝐶 in the 𝑃−𝑣\\tplot in figure 5.1 where the area under the dome ACB defines the two-phase (liquid-vapour) region, curve AC defines saturated liquid, curve BC represents saturated vapour and L, L-V, V, and G denote the liquid, liquid-vapor, vapour and gas regions respectively. The critical point has the attribute that for 𝑇>\\t𝑇P, a vapour strictly becomes a gas and cannot be condensed to form a liquid through isothermal compression. At the critical point, the distinction between liquid and vapour vanishes as the two phases then have identical properties.       Figure 5.1 P-v diagram  𝑃l is called reduced pressure while 𝑇l is called reduced temperature. The fact that all gases at the same (𝑇l,\\t𝑃l) have essentially the same 𝑧 is referred to as the principle of corresponding states. Taking advantage of this fact, generalized compressibility factor charts have been developed giving 𝑧 as a function of 𝑃l for various values of 𝑇l.'),\n",

Based on available data, all materials have been classified into four groups: Group 1 with 0.24≤𝑍P≤0.26; Group 2 with 0.26≤𝑍P≤0.28; Group 3 with 0.28≤𝑍P≤0.30; and Group 4 with 𝑍P=0.23 (the value for water). Each group yields one chart. Group 2 includes more than 60% of the substances considered and is normally regarded as adequate for all substances for most Engineering purposes. [Note: in using the chart, if either 𝑃 or 𝑇is the unknown, it can be determined only iteratively.  5.1.3 Other Equations of State: For applications where the ideal gas law is not valid and the compressibility factor method is either not suitable or not convenient, one of the many existing more complex equations of state may need to be employed. As a general rule, the most accurate equations of state are also the most complex and difficult to apply. A few of these equations of state will be presented here. The Van der Waals EOS: This is the oldest practical equation of state and it is given by (𝑃+𝑎/𝑣L)(𝑣−𝑏)=𝑅𝑇        5.24 where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are positive parameters that correct for the two limiting assumptions of the ideal gas model. Setting 𝑎=𝑏=0 converts equation 5.24 to the ideal gas equation of state. Note that 𝑅 may be replaced by 𝑅1 in equation 5.24 or in any other equation of state depending on the unit of 𝑣 and volume associated parameters. Based on the total volume, the Van der Waals equation assumes the form (𝑃+𝑎𝑚L/𝑣L)(𝑣−𝑚𝑏)=𝑚𝑅𝑇       5.25 A rearrangement of equation 5.24 gives the pressure explicit form 𝑃=:7(9Xw)−𝑎/𝑣L         5.26 The parameters 𝑎 and 𝑏 may be defined in terms of critical properties by using the fact that the isotherm 𝑇=𝑇P has a point of inflection at the critical point on the 𝑃−𝑣 diagram (see figure 5.1). The implication of this is that 4565987S=0  and  45H659H87S=0  which yield 𝑣P=3𝑏 and 𝑇P=xdLy:w. Substituting for 𝑣P and 𝑇P in equation 5.26 gives 𝑃P=𝑎/(27𝑏L). By manipulating the above relationships for 𝑇P and 𝑃P, we  have 𝑎=27𝑅L𝑇PL/(64𝑃P) and 𝑏=𝑅𝑇P/(8𝑃P).\\tWhere experimental 𝑃−𝑣−𝑇 data exist, 𝑎 and'),\n",

The Redlich-Kwong EOS: This is a better equation of state than the Van der waals equation. It involves only two parameters and it is of the form  𝑃=:7(9Xw)−d7I/H9\\t(9{w)        5.27 Modifications of the Redlich-Kwong equation such as those by Wilson and by Soave replace 𝑇E/L in equation 5.27 by more complex function of reduced temperature and accentric factor 𝜔 (a structural parameter). These upgraded versions of equation 5.27 are relatively accurate and are popular in industrial analysis.  The Benedict-Webb-Rubin EOS: The original form of the relationship is given by the relationship 𝑃=:79+}~:7Xa~X\\x7f~/7H9H +w:7Xd9\\x80+d\\x819\\x82+P9\\x807H41+∝9H8g\\x83∝\\x84H\\x85   5.28 There are eight empirical parameters involved in the equation (some extensions of the equation which have up to 20 parameters have been proposed). Extensive experimental data are required in order to evaluate these parameters. The BWR equation gives very accurate results but it is quite cumbersome to use. For example to determine 𝑣 for a given set of 𝑃 and 𝑇 would require finding the desired root of a highly non linear function of the form 𝑓(𝑣)=PI9+PH9H+P\\x809\\x80+P\\x879\\x82+P\\x889\\x8041+P\\x829H8𝑒XP\\x829H\\x85−𝑃     5.29 A computer is generally required for any serious application of the BWR equation of state. Applying a Cubic EOS: To illustrate how the equation of state of non-ideal gases can be applied in a data generation, we will make use of a cubic equation of state. The Van der Waals equation and the Redlich-Kwong equation or modifications of it fall into this class because a rearrangement of any of them would yield a cubic polynomial in 𝑣.\\tDefining 𝑣 and 𝑏 in m3/kg, the equation takes the form 𝑃=:7(9Xw)−d7I/H9\\t(9{w)        5.30 A rearrangement of equation 5.30 yields 𝑣x−𝑐L𝑣L−𝑐E𝑣−𝑐\\x8a=0        5.31 where 𝑐\\x8a=𝑎𝑏/\\x8b𝑃𝑇E/L\\x8c, 𝑐L=𝑅𝑇/\\x8b𝑃𝑇E/L\\x8c, 𝑐E=𝑐L𝑏+𝑏L−𝑐\\x8a/𝑏.'),\n",

If \\t\\t(𝑃l ,\\t\\t\\t𝑇l) gives 𝑧 to be approximately 1 for each component, then the criterion is satisfied. Let us consider a 𝑐-component gas mixture with volume 𝑉 at temperature 𝑇 and pressure 𝑃. Define\\t\\t𝑃k as the pure component pressure for component 𝑖 (this is the pressure component 𝑖 will exert at temperature 𝑇 if the \\t\\t𝑛k moles of it which the mixture contains should occupy the entire volume 𝑉 all alone), and let \\t\\t𝑉k be the pure component volume (the volume which pure component 𝑖 would occupy if \\t\\t𝑛k moles of it existed alone at 𝑇 and 𝑃). Then for an ideal gas mixture, we have \\t\\t𝑃k=\\t\\t𝑛k𝑅1𝑇/𝑉         5.40 \\t\\t𝑉k=\\t\\t𝑛k𝑅1𝑇/𝑃         5.41 𝑃=𝑛𝑅1𝑇/𝑉          5.42 𝑉=𝑛𝑅1𝑇/𝑃          5.43 Dividing equation 5.40 by 5.42 and rearranging the result, we have \\t\\t𝑃k=\\t\\t𝑛k𝑃/𝑛=\\t\\t𝑦k𝑃         5.44 A similar combination of equation 5.41 and 5.43 yields \\t\\t𝑉k=\\t\\t𝑛k𝑉/𝑛=\\t\\t𝑦k𝑉         5.46 By definition, \\t\\t𝑦k𝑃 is the partial pressure of component 𝑖 in the mixture (that is the fraction of the mixture pressure that is due to component 𝑖) and \\t\\t𝑦k𝑉 is the partial volume of component 𝑖 in the mixture. Thus, for an ideal gas, the pure component volume and the pure component pressure are respectively equal to the partial volume and partial pressure for each constituent.')]"

This helps organize the information logically and guides the reader through the process.\\n\\nDescriptive Language: The writer uses descriptive language to explain each step vividly. For example, \"mix a cup of flour with half a cup of sugar\" and \"mix the liquids and solids together until you have a smooth batter\" provide clear instructions on what to do.\\n\\nTransitional Phrases: Transitional phrases like \"First,\" \"Next,\" \"After that,\" and \"Then\" are used to smoothly transition between each step, maintaining coherence and clarity in the passage.\\n\\nImperative Verbs: Imperative verbs such as \"collect,\" \"mix,\" \"pour,\" \"wait,\" and \"flip\" are used to give direct instructions to the reader, making the process actionable and easy to follow.\\n\\nParallel Structure: The writer maintains a parallel structure in the instructions, which enhances readability and comprehension. For instance, \"mix the eggs and milk in a separate bowl\" and \"mix the liquids and solids together\" follow a consistent pattern of action.\\n\\nCulmination: The passage concludes with the final step of removing the pancake from the pan, providing a sense of completion to the process described.\\n\\nQUESTION 1B\\n\\nThe topic sentence is : “There are many steps to making pancakes.”\\n\\nQUESTION 1c\\n\\nTitle: The Importance of Transitional Markers in Writing\\n\\nTransitional markers play a crucial role in enhancing the coherence and flow of writing. These markers serve as signposts, guiding readers through the logical progression of ideas and facilitating smooth transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and sections. By employing transitional markers effectively, writers can create cohesive and well-structured pieces of writing that are easy to follow and understand.\\n\\nIn the introduction of an essay, transitional markers are essential for setting the stage and establishing the context of the topic. Phrases like \"In today\\'s society,\" \"It is widely acknowledged that,\" or \"To begin with,\" signal to the reader that a new topic or idea is about to be introduced. These markers prepare the reader for what is to come and help transition from general background information to the main thesis or argument of the essay.\\n\\nWithin body paragraphs, transitional markers facilitate the smooth flow of ideas from one point to the next. Words and phrases such as \"Furthermore,\" \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" and \"Similarly\" indicate that the writer is adding new evidence, providing further explanation, or making a comparison. These markers create coherence by linking related ideas together and reinforcing the logical progression of the argument.\\n\\nMoreover, transitional markers are essential for transitioning between different sections or subsections of an essay. For example, phrases like \"Moving on to the next aspect,\" \"Transitioning to another perspective,\" or \"Now turning our attention to\" signal a shift in focus or topic within the essay. These markers help readers navigate the structure of the essay and understand how different parts relate to each other.\\n\\nIn conclusion, transitional markers are powerful tools for improving the clarity, coherence, and flow of writing. Whether used to introduce a topic, connect ideas within paragraphs, or transition between sections, these markers help guide readers through the writer\\'s thought process and create a cohesive overall structure. By mastering the use of transitional markers, writers can effectively enhance the readability and impact of their writing.\\n\\nTop of Form\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION 2\\n\\none of the important functions\\n\\ncertain benefits\\n\\nenables him\\n\\na respected occupation\\n\\nusually assures him\\n\\ntrained men and women\\n\\nsorely needs\\n\\nincreasing need\\n\\nskilled personnel\\n\\nMost important of all\\n\\nhelps to safeguard\\n\\nour way of life\\n\\nTop of Form')]"
